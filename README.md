# 🎬 TMDB 5000 Movie Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## 🧠 Abstract & Motivation  
In today's entertainment industry, understanding what makes a movie successful is key for producers, marketers, and streaming platforms. This project aims to explore the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to identify key factors that influence a film's popularity and revenue.  
By analyzing data such as budget, genres, cast, and release dates, we seek to uncover patterns and build predictive models that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  
**Target Audience:** Movie studios, data scientists, entertainment analysts, marketing teams, and curious minds interested in film industry trends.

## 📊 Dataset Source  
The dataset used is the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), which includes detailed metadata for 5000+ movies such as titles, genres, cast, budget, revenue, and popularity scores.

## 📈 Metadata Summary  
- 🧾 **Rows:** ~5000 movies  
- 🧩 **Columns:** ~20 variables (numeric, categorical, textual, and dates)  
- 🔤 **Types:** Integer, float, string, datetime

## ❓ Research Questions & Hypotheses  
- What are the key drivers behind a movie’s popularity and box office success?  
- Are there specific genres or months that lead to better performance?  
- Can we predict a movie’s success based on its metadata?  
- Has the industry evolved over time in terms of budget and returns?

## 📉 Executive Visualizations  
We will use a variety of visualizations to support our hypotheses, such as:  
- Genre distribution and trends  
- Revenue and popularity over time  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Feature importance charts from machine learning models  

## 💡 Key Insights  
Preliminary findings suggest that higher budgets and specific genres tend to correlate with higher revenues. Some seasonal patterns in movie releases show strategic timing. Machine learning models offer predictive insights that can aid in planning and investment decisions.
